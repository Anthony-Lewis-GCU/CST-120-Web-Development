            <h2>Biography</h2>

            <p class="article" title="Formative years">
                I grew up in Healdsburg, California‚Äîa quiet town surrounded by vineyards
                and redwoods. It was the kind of place where you could hear your own thoughts, and I spent a lot
                of time doing just that. I was always searching for something‚Äîsome deeper meaning, some sense of
                direction. I didn‚Äôt know what it was yet, but I knew I wanted my life to matter.
            </p>

            <p class="article" title="Young Adult years">
                When I moved to Santa Rosa for high school, things shifted. I graduated in
                2009, and like a lot of people my age, I didn‚Äôt have a clear path laid out. So I enrolled at Santa
                Rosa Junior College and spent nearly a decade exploring different programs. I dabbled in
                everything‚Äîfrom music to tech to design‚Äîtrying to figure out what truly resonated with me. At the
                same time, I worked a string of jobs, each one teaching me something new about myself, even if none
                of them felt like ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù
            </p>

            <p class="article" title="Responsible years">
                Eventually, I found my calling in Information Technology. It clicked. I
                enrolled at Empire College and earned my Associate of Science in IT. That was a turning point. I
                started working in the industry and built a solid foundation over seven years. I was proud of the
                work I was doing, and for a while, it felt like I was finally on track.
            </p>

            <p class="article" title="The Lost Years">
                But life doesn‚Äôt always move in a straight line. Somewhere along the way, I
                lost myself. I got caught up in the party scene, started using cocaine, and before I knew it, it had
                taken over my life. What started as weekend fun became a daily habit. I was spiraling‚Äîmy job was on
                the line, my health was deteriorating, and I felt completely disconnected from who I used to be.
            </p>

            <p class="article" title="The Lost Years">
                I tried to escape by moving out of town for a fresh start. I managed to
                stay sober for about six months, but then I relapsed. The depression hit hard, and I fell back into
                the cycle. That‚Äôs when I made the hardest, most important, and best decision of my life: I checked
                into Touchstone Recovery Center in Fresno, California.
            </p>

            <p class="article" title="The Lost Years">
                I spent 30 days in inpatient rehab, facing everything I had been running
                from. It wasn‚Äôt easy. But it was necessary. After that, I continued with aftercare, and slowly, I
                started rebuilding. As of September 21, 2025, I‚Äôve been sober for 19 months. That number means
                everything to me. It‚Äôs not just time‚Äîit‚Äôs proof that I can change.
            </p>

            <p class="article" title="Present Day">
                Now, I‚Äôm enrolled at Grand Canyon University. I‚Äôm taking my life back, one
                step at a time. I‚Äôm not the same person I used to be‚Äîand I don‚Äôt want to be. I‚Äôve learned that
                healing isn‚Äôt linear, and growth doesn‚Äôt come without pain. But I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm present. And I‚Äôm
                building a future that reflects who I truly am.
