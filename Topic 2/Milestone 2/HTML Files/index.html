            <h2>Biography</h2>

            <p title="Formative years">
                I grew up in Healdsburg, California‚Äîa quiet town surrounded by vineyards
                and redwoods. It was the kind of place where you could hear your own thoughts, and I spent a lot
                of time doing just that. I was always searching for something‚Äîsome deeper meaning, some sense of
                direction. I didn‚Äôt know what it was yet, but I knew I wanted my life to matter.
            </p>

            <p title="Young Adult years">
                When I moved to Santa Rosa for high school, things shifted. I graduated in
                2009, and like a lot of people my age, I didn‚Äôt have a clear path laid out. So I enrolled at Santa
                Rosa Junior College and spent nearly a decade exploring different programs. I dabbled in
                everything‚Äîfrom music to tech to design‚Äîtrying to figure out what truly resonated with me. At the
                same time, I worked a string of jobs, each one teaching me something new about myself, even if none
                of them felt like ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù
            </p>

            <p title="Responsible years">
                Eventually, I found my calling in Information Technology. It clicked. I
                enrolled at Empire College and earned my Associate of Science in IT. That was a turning point. I
                started working in the industry and built a solid foundation over seven years. I was proud of the
                work I was doing, and for a while, it felt like I was finally on track.
            </p>

            <p title="The Lost Years">
                But life doesn‚Äôt always move in a straight line. Somewhere along the way, I
                lost myself. I got caught up in the party scene, started using cocaine, and before I knew it, it had
                taken over my life. What started as weekend fun became a daily habit. I was spiraling‚Äîmy job was on
                the line, my health was deteriorating, and I felt completely disconnected from who I used to be.<br><br>
            
                I tried to escape by moving out of town for a fresh start. I managed to
                stay sober for about six months, but then I relapsed. The depression hit hard, and I fell back into
                the cycle. That‚Äôs when I made the hardest, most important, and best decision of my life: I checked
                into Touchstone Recovery Center in Fresno, California.<br><br>
            
                I spent 30 days in inpatient rehab, facing everything I had been running
                from. It wasn‚Äôt easy. But it was necessary. After that, I continued with aftercare, and slowly, I
                started rebuilding. As of September 21, 2025, I‚Äôve been sober for 19 months. That number means
                everything to me. It‚Äôs not just time‚Äîit‚Äôs proof that I can change.
            </p>

            <p title="Present Day">
                Now, I‚Äôm enrolled at Grand Canyon University. I‚Äôm taking my life back, one
                step at a time. I‚Äôm not the same person I used to be‚Äîand I don‚Äôt want to be. I‚Äôve learned that
                healing isn‚Äôt linear, and growth doesn‚Äôt come without pain. But I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm present. And I‚Äôm
                building a future that reflects who I truly am.

                        <h4>Growth</h4>
                        <p id="Growth">I am not who I was‚Äîand I will not stay who I am. Growth is my commitment to
                            becoming better, wiser, and more capable with every challenge I face. It is the heartbeat of
                            my transformation.</p>

                        <h4>Accountability</h4>
                        <p id="Accountability">I own my actions, my past, and my future. Accountability means facing
                            consequences, making amends, and building trust through consistency‚Äînot excuses.</p>

                        <!--Core value description to be displayed when the user clicks the "Empathy" Value-->
                        <h4>Empathy</h4>
                        <p id="Empathy">Understanding others is not just emotional‚Äîit is strategic. Empathy helps me
                            build better systems, better relationships, and better communities. It is how I connect and
                            collaborate.</p>

                        <h4>Creativity</h4>
                        <p id="Creativity">Whether I am designing wireframes or composing music, creativity is how I
                            solve problems and express truth. It is the spark that turns logic into art and chaos into
                            clarity.</p>

                        <!--Core value description to be displayed when the user clicks the "Mastery" Value-->
                        <h4>Mastery</h4>
                        <p id="Mastery">I do not settle for ‚Äúgood enough.‚Äù Mastery is my pursuit of excellence‚Äîthrough
                            repetition, refinement, and obsession with detail. It is the difference between knowing and
                            owning.</p>
                        
                        <!--Core value description to be displayed when the user clicks the "Community" Value-->
                        <h4>Community</h4>
                        <p id="Community">I thrive in connection‚Äîwhether it is a coding meetup, a recovery circle, or a
                            shared playlist. Community gives my work meaning and my story context. I build with others
                            in mind.</p>
                        
                        <!--Core value description to be displayed when the user clicks the "Courage" Value-->
                        <h4>Courage</h4>
                        <p id="Courage">Courage is not loud, it is the quiet decision to keep going. It is walking into
                            rehab, sharing my truth, and choosing growth over comfort. It is the backbone of every value
                            I live by.</p>
